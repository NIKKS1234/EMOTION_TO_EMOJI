# EMOTION_TO_EMOJI
#PROJECT AIM:Our project aims to develop a model which takes the video of a person as an input and displays the emotion using an emoji. This model uses deep learning concepts to recognize the emotion of one or multiple person at a time.
#BRIEF WALKTHROUGH:
1)LOADING THE APPROPRIATE DATA SET CONTAINING SUFFICIENT IMAGES OF ALL 7 TYPES OF EMOTIONS 
2)DATA AUGUMENTATION AND IMAGE PRE-PROCESSING USING “ImageGenerator” and “.flow_from_directory”
3)BUILDING THE CNN ARCHITECTURE 
4)COMPILING OUR MODEL USING LOSS, OPTIMIZERS (Adam) & METRICS
5)TRAINING OUR MODEL WITH TRAINING SET AND SAVING OUR MODEL
6)EVALUATING TESTING ACCURACY 
7)USING OPENCV WHICH IS A REAL TIME COMPUTER VISION LIBRARY TO CAPTURE THE VIDEO USING APPROPRIATE FRAME 
8)MAPPING THE EMOJIS WITH THE HIGHEST PROBABLE EMOTION 
9)USING FLASK FRAMEWORK TO BUILD A WEBPAGE
